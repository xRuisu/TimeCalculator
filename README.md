# TimeCalculator
Simple calculator that adds various minutes to return the total time calculated.

This is very basic code that started as a "Driving Calculator" later renamed to "Time Calculator".
This was my very first java coding project for myself to test my coding progress.

This was around when I was working on a driving log for getting my drivers license. 
I wanted a simple program that could take all my hours logged and print/display the data.

All I had to do was continuously enter all the time into the program, type "print" 
and then get the result of all the time recorded, so that I can also find out how many hours
of driving left were needed.

I uploaded this project to help showcase how my coding has progressed. I'm a self-study student
who has been messing with code since I was 12, however too it more seriously around 20 years old.

Despite not having college education, I'm considerably happy with the progress I've made
and I'm still very determined to further my self-journey in programming and showcasing my skills in IT.

This was my very first functional java coding project I started after feeling confident in my studies.
