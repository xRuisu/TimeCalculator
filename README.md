# Time Calculator
Simple calculator that adds various minutes to return the total time calculated.

This is very basic code that started as a "Driving Calculator" later renamed to "Time Calculator".
This was my very first java coding project for myself to test my coding progress.

This was around when I was working on a driving log for getting my drivers license. 
I wanted a simple program that could take all my hours logged and print/display the data.

All I had to do was continuously enter all the time into the program, type "print" 
and then get the result of all the time recorded, so that I can also find out how many hours
of driving left were needed.

I uploaded this project to help showcase my coding progress. I'm a self-study student
who has been messing with code since I was 12, became a hobby around 16 years old, and finally
took it more serously around 20 years old.

Despite not having a college education, I'm considerably happy with the progress I've made
and I'm still very determined to further my self-learning journey in programming and showcasing my skills in IT.

This was my very first functional java coding program I started after feeling confident in my studies.
